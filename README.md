# Task Manager App
This is a task manager project I made for a college assigment in `2025`

# Instructions:
Please make sure not to modify the core folders, as it wil mess with the whole coding.

# First Set Up:
Check your node and npm version with: 
```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
```
My versions are respectively: `v22.14.0` & `v10.9.2`
- Please, open your local terminal on VSCode and write the following:
```bash
  cd ToDoApp 
  npm install (for node_modules folder)
  npm install @react-native-picker/picker --save (for the picker feature at the main screen)
  npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (for the storage feature)
  npm install reactive-native-calendars (for the reactive native calendar component)
```
Obs.: In order for the code to run properly into Expo Go, it is very IMPORTANT that the first command is done IF you clone this repository. Otherwhise, if you download the code and run it in a folder, you do not need to change and directory, just proceed to install al the components and modules.

# Tasks:
The features for tasks are all done in an intuitive and simple way, in order to make it easier to handle your tasks and see what is going on. Some updates in the UI and UX might come soon, whenever I get some time to work on it.
